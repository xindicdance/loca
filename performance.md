### Yeee, Bubbles disappear
05/2023, Trondheim, Norway  
a lecture-performance  
in collaboration with Julio Maquilón

I have a friend from Ecuador. The first time I visited his room, I noticed he had hung his country's national flag on the wall beside his bed. I was shocked, "I can’t fall asleep with my national flag in my bedroom."

### Looking for a River 
08/2021, Shanghai, China  
concept, choreographer, performer  

*The flowing river is the flowing reality  
The reality runs through my body*  
How do people’s thinking  connect with their bodies’ senses?  
How does the change from the subject-object dichotomous epistemology to the unified phenomenological method relate to the body transition in the history of philosophy?  
How can a person become unified? Is the body a channel?

### 知行合一2.0 Zhi Xing He Yi 2.0 
08/2021, Shanghai Suoshi Theatre, China  
concept, choreographer, performer  

“Zhi Xing He Yi” is a philosophical idea of Wang Yangming, who was a thinker in China Ming Dynasty. I intentionally  misused it as the title of this work to show the irony —- the unity of knowledge and action (translated literally).
